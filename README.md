## Welcome to Cloud Native Community Group Panama

The **Cloud Native Community Group Panama (CNCG Panama)** is the meeting point for the **[Cloud Native Community](https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-panama/)** in our country to **connect, communicate, and collaborate** with developer peers and DevOps professionals.

As part of the **[global network of CNCF Community Groups](https://community.cncf.io/)**, we strive to distribute knowledge related to Cloud Native technologies (Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, etc.), share resources, and build a more inclusive community for everyone interested in the cloud-native ecosystem.

### Our Mission
Our mission is to strengthen the tech landscape in Panama by providing a platform to **expand Cloud Native expertise**, boost local talent, and inspire innovation.

We achieve this by hosting talks with industry leaders and local experts, organizing community meetups, hands-on workshops, and major events like **KCD Panama**—fostering collaboration both online and in person.
